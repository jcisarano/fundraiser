## Fundraiser site (2015)

Sample from a now-defunct fundraising website intended for school organizations and the like to use to pay for new equipment, trips, uniforms, etc. The organization leader would configure a fundraising campaign and then invite members of the group to participate and raise money towards the goal. The twist with this one is that the members would offer services like dog walking, lawn mowing, car washing, etc in exchange for the donation. Members each had a page for the campaign that they could customize with images and text to show how the organization was important to them.

This site is a bit cleaner than the Faction Wars one, but it still does not use a framework like Laravel. I did not start my first Laravel site until a year or two after this was complete. I did all the programming here, so what you see, good or bad, is on me. One of the improvements over Faction Wars is that it has a better separation of view elements from data, and it uses Handlebars.js to inject data into view templates. This one uses a few other third-party libraries as well, like Bootstrap, JQuery, and Mandrill for email.

Layout images are in the docs directory. I used Bootstrap and custom css to match the layouts as closely as possible.
